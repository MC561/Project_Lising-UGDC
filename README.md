# Project_Lising-UGDC
In order to make my game i had to download a total of I think 10 assets that took me 1 hour or more to find. Then I manually scaled my camp and built the camp.I also included some patches of vegetiation around with 2 main bodies of water.
One of the lakes has a medieval village on it which is highly detailed as well.I also hand made the dungeon where the mobs spawn.

One of the problems are that i can't get the spitter to move.Other problems I don't know how to fix.

I learn't that i should start my project early instead of the last minute.
